You are given a weekly allowance of ₦2000. Your job is to use Python assignment operators to simulate how you spend and manage your money throughout the week.

✅ Instructions:

Write a Python program that performs the following steps and prints the allowance after each one:

You spent ₦400 on books.


You found ₦100 under your bed and added it to your allowance.


You bought snacks worth ₦250.


You gave 25% of your current allowance to your younger sibling.


You used one-third of what’s left to buy data.


You split the remaining balance equally between savings and tithing.


Finally, calculate what remains after removing all complete ₦100 notes using the modulus assignment operator (%=).
